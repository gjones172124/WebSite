# WebSite
Portfolio Website

I spent one weekend using my basic skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery & Bootstrap) to make a personal website. 
I wanted to create a webpage that conveyed my front end skills without having too many different pages.
So I created an easy one page website that has links to jump you to different sections within the page.
